        <h2>Sophomore from It's None of Your Business, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p> I am a Sophomore at University studying Ministry & Leadership with a minor in Political Science. I enjoy learning about how the world works through all of my different classes here at school.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy creative endevors such as painting, music, dance, gymnastics and writing. While I cannot do it much in school, I love reading books with creative worldbuilding, believable characters, and interesting government systems. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy working with kids at my local churches. My favorite thing to do in the summer is leading worship through dance at my home church's VBS program.
